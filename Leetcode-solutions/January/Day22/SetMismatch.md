# 645. Set Mismatch


You are given a set of integers `s`, which originally contains all the numbers from 1 to n. Unfortunately, due to some error, one of the numbers in `s` got duplicated to another number in the set, resulting in the repetition of one number and the loss of another number.

You are given an integer array `nums` representing the data status of this set after the error.

**Task:**

Find the number that occurs twice and the number that is missing and return them in the form of an array.

**Input:**

- An integer array `nums` representing the data status of the set after the error.

**Output:**

- Return an array containing the duplicate and missing numbers.


### Approach:

The provided solution follows a straightforward approach using an array (`numCount`) to count the occurrences of each number. The main steps include:

1. **Count Occurrences:**
   - Create an array `numCount` to count the occurrences of each number from 1 to n.
   - Iterate through the input array `nums` and update the counts in the `numCount` array.

2. **Identify Duplicate and Missing Numbers:**
   - Iterate through the `numCount` array.
   - If the count at an index is 0, it means that the corresponding number is missing.
   - If the count at an index is 2, it means that the corresponding number is a duplicate.

3. **Return Result:**
   - Return an array containing the identified duplicate and missing numbers.

### Intuition:

- **Counting Occurrences:**
  - By counting the occurrences of each number in the array, we create a mapping of how many times each number appears.

- **Identifying Duplicate and Missing Numbers:**
  - A count of 0 at a particular index in `numCount` indicates a missing number.
  - A count of 2 at a particular index in `numCount` indicates a duplicate number.

- **Efficiency:**
  - This approach is efficient because it avoids sorting or using additional space.
  - It leverages the array `numCount` to keep track of counts and easily identify duplicates and missing numbers.

### Example:

Consider the array `nums = [3, 1, 3, 4, 2]`. The solution proceeds as follows:

1. Count Occurrences:
   ```
   numCount = [0, 1, 1, 2, 1]
   ```

2. Identify Duplicate and Missing Numbers:
   - Iterate through `numCount`.
     - At index 1: count is 0, so 1 is missing.
     - At index 2: count is 1, so 2 is not missing or duplicate.
     - At index 3: count is 1, so 3 is the duplicate.
     - At index 4: count is 2, so 4 is not missing or duplicate.

3. Return Result:
   - Duplicate Number: 3
   - Missing Number: 1

Result: `[3, 1]`

### Summary:

This approach efficiently utilizes counting to identify duplicates and missing numbers without sorting or using additional space. The intuition lies in recognizing that the count array provides valuable information about the occurrences of each number in the array. The approach is both intuitive and effective for solving the problem.



## Code

```javascript 
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var findErrorNums = function(nums) {
    // Get the length of the input array nums
    let n = nums.length;

    // Create an array to count the occurrences of each number, initialize all elements to 0
    let numCount = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    // Variables to store the missing and duplicate numbers
    let missingVal = 0;
    let duplicateVal = 0;

    // Iterate through the nums array and update the counts in the numCount array
    for (const num of nums) {
        numCount[num]++;
    }

    // Iterate through the numCount array to find the duplicate and missing numbers
    for (let i = 1; i < numCount.length; i++) {
        // If the count is 0, it means the number is missing
        if (numCount[i] === 0) {
            missingVal = i;
        }
        // If the count is 2, it means the number is a duplicate
        else if (numCount[i] === 2) {
            duplicateVal = i;
        }
    }

    // Return an array containing the duplicate and missing numbers
    return [duplicateVal, missingVal];
};
```
