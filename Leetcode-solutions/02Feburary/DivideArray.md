# 2966. Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference

The problem involves dividing an integer array `nums` into one or more arrays of size 3, satisfying two conditions:
1. Each element of `nums` should be in exactly one array.
2. The difference between any two elements in one array is less than or equal to `k`.

The goal is to return a 2D array containing all the arrays that satisfy the conditions. If it's impossible to satisfy the conditions, the function should return an empty array. If there are multiple valid solutions, any of them can be returned.

**Solution:**

The provided solution begins by sorting the `nums` array in ascending order. Then, it iterates through the sorted array with a step of 3 (i.e., considering every group of three consecutive elements). For each group of three, it checks whether the difference between the first and last elements of the group is less than or equal to `k`. If this condition is met, the group is added to the result array. If at any point the condition is not satisfied, an empty array is returned.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n)
  - Sorting the array has a time complexity of O(n log n).
  - The subsequent loop has a linear time complexity O(n/3), which simplifies to O(n).

- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - The space complexity is dominated by the result array, which can have a maximum size of n/3, and thus, the space complexity is O(n).

**Intuition and Approach:**

1. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting the array helps in efficiently finding groups of three with consecutive elements.
   - It simplifies the process of checking the condition that the difference between the first and last elements in each group should be less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Grouping:**
   - The iteration through the sorted array in groups of three ensures that each group satisfies the conditions mentioned in the problem.

3. **Condition Check:**
   - The condition check ensures that the elements within each group are within the specified range, making sure the solution meets the problem requirements.

**Prerequisites:**

- Understanding of array manipulation and sorting algorithms.
- Knowledge of basic conditional checks and array iteration.
- Familiarity with time and space complexity analysis.

## Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums - The input array of integers
 * @param {number} k - The positive integer specifying the maximum difference allowed within a group
 * @return {number[][]} - A 2D array containing arrays of size 3 that satisfy the conditions
 */
var divideArray = function(nums, k) {
    // Sort the input array in ascending order
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Initialize an empty array to store the result
    let res = [];

    // Iterate through the sorted array in groups of three
    for (let i = 2; i < nums.length; i += 3) {
        // Check if the difference between the first and last elements in the group is greater than k
        if (nums[i] - nums[i - 2] > k) {
            // If the condition is not satisfied, return an empty array
            return [];
        }

        // Add the current group to the result array
        res.push([nums[i - 2], nums[i - 1], nums[i]]);
    }

    // Return the final result array containing valid groups
    return res;
};
